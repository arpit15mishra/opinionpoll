this is a simple opinion poll application made using turbo c++ program that uses graphics.h library to implement graphics.
It uses files to store important data required for processing later. 
This application is created with the aim to ease the process of decision making in an organisation. Using this application an organisation 
can take survey from student regarding major issues which inturn can help organisation in effective decision making.there is also a column for 
feedback where the students can give there feedback about various issues.


At the root level a header file is made which declares the various objects like buttons, dialogboxes and images boxes that are used frequently 
in the application .At next level there is a base.cpp file which declares various interfaces that are used in the program like the menus, the 
file handing etc. Then we have the main.cpp program that uses which interfaces to develop the actual program.


the file handling part still needs some improvement.......
